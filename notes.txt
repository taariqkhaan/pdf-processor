write a program using C#, .NET 8.0.
accepts a pdf file and output folder path as parameter
look for a data.db in the same folder as the pdf file.
looks for table called "pdf_table" inside the database.
contains bottom-left coordinate in X1, Y1 columns.
contains top-right coordinate in X2, Y2 columns.
above coordinates were extracted using PDFpig.
SheetNumber column contains the pdf page number.
sort the table by SheetNumber ascending, ItemNumber ascending, Type alphabetical.

go row-by-row in Type Column
if value is "from_desc" then place a red dot at the corresponding bottom-left and top-right coordinates.
if null, continue.
save the highlighted pdf in the output folder as highlighted_pdf.pdf
use PdfSharp + MigraDoc for annotation. 
Take into account any difference in coordinate systems.


namespace PdfProcessor.Services
{
    public class CoordinateDotService
    {
        //put logic in a method here
    }
}

Console.WriteLine($"Page {pageIndex} rotation: {page.Rotation}");
